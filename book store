        This is a book about self-sabotage. Why we do it, when we do it, and how to stop doing 
        it—for good. Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. 
        This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile. 
        But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional 
        intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences 
        at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can
        step out of our own way and into our potential. For centuries, the mountain has been 
        used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible
        to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of 
        excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb. 
        In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves.

            She finally thought she was safe…

            Toni Maguire, author of Number One Bestseller ‘Don't Tell Mummy’, takes up the story of her tragic
            childhood where she left off, revealing the awful truth about what happened when her father, sent to
            jail for abusing her, was released, and came home…
            
            Toni Maguire's father abused her from the age of six, and was only found out when she fell pregnant,
            losing the child from a botched abortion. Jailed for his crimes with the help of her testimony,
            Antoinette believed she was finally safe, but it was not to last…
            
            Being despatched to collect her father from the station by herself marked a new low for young Antoinette.
            Realising that she was no longer safe at home, she was forced to leave. Her mother did nothing to protect
            her or prevent her going.
            
            Traumatised and alone, Antoinette was unable to cope, and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, sinking
            deeper into despair every day. Finally transferred to the dead-end ward with no hope of recovery, 
            Antoinette slowly began to improve, by the sheer force of her indomitable will.

         From The Brighter the Light author Mary Ellen Taylor comes an uplifting tale of hope and love between a 
         mother and daughter as they learn that life is a masterpiece in the making.

         When artist Dani Manchester learns she’s slowly losing her vision, she becomes unmoored. Her ex-husband 
         died only months before, leaving Dani and her preteen daughter grief stricken. Suddenly, the life Dani 
         built for her family on the Outer Banks feels like a painful reminder of all they’ve lost.

         On a whim, Dani sells her waterfront home and buys an old farm inland near the Virginia state line. But
          Dani’s daughter recoils at the sudden, drastic change. The Outer Banks’ sun-swept beaches, pink dawns, 
          and savage storms are all she’s ever known.

         But Dani is resolute, and the pair move to Virginia to embark on a challenging renovation. That summer, 
         their efforts to turn a run-down silo into an art studio bring forth new friends, new loves, and new challenges.

         As mother and daughter navigate the fiercest storm of their lives, they learn that instead of waiting for
        the skies to clear, they can withstand the wind and rain, so long as they do it together.

         During a bombing campaign over Romanian oil fields, hundreds of American airmen were shot down in Nazi-occupied
        Yugoslavia. Local Serbian farmers and peasants risked their own lives to give refuge to the soldiers while they 
        waited for rescue, and in 1944, Operation Halyard was born. The risks were incredible. The starving Americans in 
        Yugoslavia had to construct a landing strip large enough for C-47 cargo planes—without tools, without alerting 
        the Germans, and without endangering the villagers. And the cargo planes had to make it through enemy airspace 
        and back—without getting shot down themselves.

       "Things We Don't Talk About" is a short collection of thoughts, quotes and poetry highlighting some hardships 
       of living with depression and mental illness and the effects it has on relationships with yourself and loved 
       ones. It's a personal lens into the darkest places your mind can take you and the struggle of battling your 
       own mind. It's a peak of what's underneath the surface that most people battle in silence, something you may 
       or may not relate to. If you're reading this, it's not too late and you're not alone. In addition, I just 
       wanted to say thank you for allowing me to share a part of me, whether it was specifically of value to you. 
       I hope to make at least one person in this world to feel less alone. Communication and or expressing our feelings, 
       it's one of the hardest things to do. Often we get discouraged to even try to express ourselves due to the fear 
       of not being understood and or not doing it the "right" way. We are all human and the best thing we can do is to 
       continue trying. Please keep an open mind and always lead with love.

          This collection of poetry is about power, resilience, overcoming hard times, and unleashing the chains we 
          put on ourselves. These are stories of realizations, heartache, family trauma, healing, blooming love, and 
          finding meaning. In my life I've learned that through the dark times, we must be our own source of light. 
          We have to bring our own sunshine on a cloudy day. We must find ourselves and know our truth in order to 
          learn our purpose. Stories of Heartache - These are the times when we feel broken. This shattering feeling 
          comes from family trauma, bad relationships, mental illness, and the weight of the world on our shoulders.
